At any given time several distinct crawls are running, some for months, and some every day or longer.

	  <p>Web wide crawl with initial seedlist and crawler configuration from March 2011.  This uses the new HQ software for distributed crawling by Kenji Nagahashi.</p>

<p>What’s in the data set:<br />
<br />
Crawl start date: 09 March, 2011<br />
Crawl end date: 23 December, 2011<br />
Number of captures: 2,713,676,341<br />
Number of unique URLs: 2,273,840,159<br />
Number of hosts: 29,032,069</p>

<p>The seed list for this crawl was a list of Alexa’s top 1 million web sites, retrieved close to the crawl start date.  We used Heritrix (3.1.1-SNAPSHOT) crawler software and respected robots.txt directives.  The scope of the crawl was not limited except for a few manually excluded sites.</p>  

<p>However this was a somewhat experimental crawl for us, as we were using newly minted software to feed URLs to the crawlers, and we know there were some operational issues with it.  For example, in many cases we may not have crawled all of the embedded and linked objects in a page since the URLs for these resources were added into queues that quickly grew bigger than the intended size of the crawl (and therefore we never got to them).  We also included repeated crawls of some Argentinian government sites, so looking at results by country will be somewhat skewed.</p>  

<p>We have made many changes to how we do these wide crawls since this particular example, but we wanted to make the data available “warts and all” for people to experiment with.  We have also done some <a href="http://archive.org/~vinay/wide/wide-00002.html">further analysis of the content</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like access to this set of crawl data, please contact us at info at archive dot org and let us know who you are and what you’re hoping to do with it.  We may not be able to say “yes” to all requests, since we’re just figuring out whether this is a good idea, but everyone will be considered.</p>

    <h3><a name="1"></a>Consent Agenda</h3>
    <p>RESOLVED, the following resolutions in this
      Consent Agenda are hereby approved:</p>
    <h4><a name="1.1"></a><strong>1.1. </strong>Approval
      of Minutes of 25 January 2011 ICANN Special Board
      Meeting</h4>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.01), the Board hereby approves
      the minutes of the 25 January 2011 ICANN Special
      Board Meeting.</p>
    <h4><a name="1.2"></a>1.2. Approval of Changes
      to SSAC Membership</a></h4>
    <p>Whereas, the Security and Stability Advisory
      Committee (SSAC) does review its membership and
      make adjustments from time-to-time.</p>
    <p>Whereas, the SSAC Membership Committee, on behalf
      of the SSAC, requests that the Board should appoint
      David Conrad to the SSAC.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.02), that the Board appoints
      David Conrad to the SSAC.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>Rationale for Resolution 2011.03.18.02</em></p>
      <p><em>The SSAC is a diverse group of individuals
          whose expertise in specific subject matters
          enables the SSAC to fulfill its charter and
          execute its mission. Since its inception,
          the SSAC has invited individuals with deep
          knowledge and experience in technical and
          security areas that are critical to the security
          and stability of the Internet's domain name
          system.</em></p>
      <p><em>The SSAC's continued operation as a competent
          body is dependent on the accrual of talented
          subject matter experts who have consented
          to volunteer their time and energies to the
          execution of the SSAC mission. David Conrad
          has been providing his expertise to the SSAC,
          both while he was an ICANN staff member and
          more recently as an Invited Guest. The SSAC
          will benefit from David's commitment as a
          full member, which will give the SSAC access
          to skills that are essential for the SSAC
          to fulfill its responsibilities.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4><a name="1.3"></a>1.3. ccNSO Review – Receipt
      of Board WG Final Report and Dissolution of the
      WG</h4>
    <p>Whereas, the ccNSO review Working Group has
      delivered to the Structural Improvements Committee
      (SIC) its final report of activity, which contains
      conclusions and recommendations for enhancing
      the effectiveness of this structure.</p>
    <p>Whereas, the ccNSO review Working Group has
      fulfilled the tasks assigned to it at the time
      of their establishment, and it can now be dissolved.</p>
    <p>Whereas, the Board agrees with the SIC on its
      proposal to thank the Chair and Members of the
      Working Group for their commitment and ability
      to fulfill the tasks assigned to them; and</p>
    <p>Whereas, the SIC will provide the Board with
      a set of suggested actions to address the conclusions
      and recommendations of the final report of this
      Working Group.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.03), the Board receives
      the final report of the ccNSO review Working
      Group.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.04), the Board dissolves
      the ccNSO Review Working Group and thanks the
      Chair and Members of the ccNSO review Working
      Group: Jean-Jacques Subrenat (Chair), Ram Mohan,
      Demi Getschko, Alejandro Pisanty and Vittorio
      Bertola, for their commitment and ability to
      fulfill their tasks.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.05), the Board directs
      the Structural Improvements Committee to present
      a set of suggested actions for approval at the
      24 June 2011 Board meeting, so as to address
      the conclusions and recommendations formulated
      in the final report of this Working Group.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>Rationale for Resolution 2011.03.18.03-2011.03.18.05</em></p>
      <p><em>The proposed actions conclude an important
          step in the review process and pave the way
          for implementation planning and implementation
          of the recommended measures, with a view
          to fulfilling the purpose of the review,
          notably improvements of the ccNSO. The actions
          can be achieved through efforts of existing
          ICANN staff and are not anticipated to entail
          any budgetary consequences. No potential
          negative effects with the actions have been
          identified and there are no advantages to
          gain by delaying the actions.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4><a name="1.4"></a>1.4. Approval of Revision
      of Bylaws re: Implementation of SSAC Review Working
      Group Report</h4>
    <p>A. Bylaws change</p>
    <p>Whereas, Article XI, Section 2, Subsection 2
      of the Bylaws governs the Security and Stability
      Advisory Committee (SSAC).</p>
    <p>Whereas, in its final report published 29 January
      2010 &lt;<a href="/web/20110423020356/http://icann.org/en/reviews/ssac/ssac-review-wg-final-report-29jan10-en.pdf">http://www.icann.org/en/reviews/ssac/ssac-review-wg-final-report-29jan10-en.pdf</a>&gt; [PDF,
      282 KB], the Security and Stability Advisory
      Committee (SSAC) recommended that task area one
      of the SSAC Charter (Section 2(2)(a)(1) &lt;<a href="/web/20110423020356/http://icann.org/en/general/bylaws.htm#XI">http://www.icann.org/en/general/bylaws.htm#XI</a>&gt;)
      should be removed because it is out of scope
      of the activities of the SSAC.</p>
    <p>Whereas, on 12 March 2010, the Board received
      the SSAC final report and directed the Structural
      Improvements Committee (SIC) to identify actions
      necessary to address the recommendations within
      the report, at &lt;<a href="/web/20110423020356/http://icann.org/en/minutes/resolutions-12mar10-en.htm#1.6">http://www.icann.org/en/minutes/resolutions-12mar10-en.htm#1.6</a>&gt;.</p>
    <p>Whereas, the SIC, at its 14 October 2010 meeting,
      recommended that the Bylaws should be amended
      to achieve the recommendation of the Working
      Group on improvements to the SSAC by removing
      task area one and renumbering the other task
      areas.</p>
    <p>Whereas, the SIC also considered the SSAC reviewer's
      recommendation that the Board should have the
      power to remove SSAC members, and recommended
      that the Bylaws should be amended to reflect
      this companion removal power. Any removal should
      be formed in consultation with the SSAC.</p>
    <p>Whereas, in resolution <a href="/web/20110423020356/http://icann.org/en/minutes/resolutions-28oct10-en.htm">2010.28.10.11</a> the
      Board directed staff to post the proposed Bylaws
      amendments for a period of no less than 30 days.</p>
    <p>Whereas, the proposed amendments were posted
      for public comment for a period of 30 days beginning
      03 November 2010 and ending 02 December 2010.</p>
    <p>Whereas, staff provided the Board with a summary
      and analysis of the public comments received
      and recommended that the Board approve the Bylaws
      amendments as posted at &lt;<a href="/web/20110423020356/http://icann.org/en/general/proposed-bylaw-changes-xi-2-03nov10-en.pdf">http://www.icann.org/en/general/proposed-bylaw-changes-xi-2-03nov10-en.pdf</a>&gt; [PDF,
      60 KB].</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.06), the Board approves
      the Bylaws revisions as posted for public comment
      in furtherance of the recommendations arising
      out of the SSAC review Working Group.</p>
    <p>B. Task to develop a security framework</p>
    <p>Whereas, in its final report published 29 January
      2010 &lt;<a href="/web/20110423020356/http://icann.org/en/reviews/ssac/ssac-review-wg-final-report-29jan10-en.pdf">http://www.icann.org/en/reviews/ssac/ssac-review-wg-final-report-29jan10-en.pdf</a>&gt; [PDF,
      210],
      the Security and Stability Advisory Committee
      (SSAC) recommended that task area one of the
      SSAC Charter (Section 2(2)(a)(1) &lt;<a href="/web/20110423020356/http://icann.org/en/general/bylaws.htm#XI">http://www.icann.org/en/general/bylaws.htm#XI</a>&gt;)
      should be removed because it is out of scope
      of the activities of the SSAC.</p>
    <p>Whereas, on 18 March 2011, the Board approved
      the amendment to the Bylaws reflecting the removal
      of task area one from the SSAC Charter, which
      read &quot;To develop a security framework for
      Internet naming and address allocation services
      that defines the key focus areas, and identifies
      where the responsibilities for each area lie.
      The committee shall focus on the operational
      considerations of critical naming infrastructure.&quot;</p>
    <p>Whereas, the ICANN Board desires that the work
      foreseen within task area should be performed
      by ICANN.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.07), the Board directs
      the Board Governance Committee to recommend to
      the Board a working group to oversee the development
      of a risk management framework and system for
      the DNS as it pertains to ICANN's role as defined
      in the ICANN Bylaws. The Board recommends that
      the BGC consider in its recommendation the inclusion
      of a member of the working group to come from
      the SSAC. The Board requests that the BGC submit
      its recommendation consideration at the Board
      meeting in Singapore in June 2011.</p>

        <p><em>Rationale for Resolutions 2011.03.18.06
            and 2011.03.18.07</em></p>
        <p><em>The proposed actions are in line with
            the adopted implementation plan following
            the SSAC Review and serve to fulfil the
            commitments agreed by the Board to that
            end. The Bylaws changes have been posted
            for public comments. No comments were received
            indicating any foreseen negative effects
            and there is no reason to delay the adoption
            of the amendment. The task to develop a
            security framework is intended to fulfil
            the Board's expressed desire that work
            within task area one of the SSAC Charter
            should be performed by ICANN. There is
            no reason to delay the scoping task as
            it there are no budgetary consequences
            to performing the scoping work. The outcomes
            of that scoping work should explicitly
            address resource estimates, to be considered
            and decided by the Board once the scoping
            task has been accomplished and a proposal
            put forward. The approval of initiating
            the scoping work will assist ICANN in continuing
            to work to maintain security, stability

    <blockquote>
      <p><em>Rationale for Resolution 2011.03.18.11</em></p>
      <p><em>While ICANN continues to examine the overall
          structure of the Meetings and conferences
          it conducts, including the number, type and
          geographic rotation, it is important to identify
          and publish proposed dates for ICANN Meetings
          through 2016. Publishing the Meeting dates
          is important to prevent conflicts with other
          community events, as well as to allow ICANN
          Meeting participants to plan for their attendance.</em></p>
      <p><em>The proposed dates were selected based
          on careful avoidance of important holidays,
          celebrations, and observances around the
          globe. Similarly, every effort was made to
          identify and prevent scheduling conflicts
          with other community events. Staff recommendations
          were then developed for review by members
          of the ICANN Public Participation Committee,
          and subsequently published for a 15-day public
          comment period. Though commenters noted that
          conflicts remained for two of the June meeting
          dates, there are no sufficient alternative
          dates available for those meetings.</em></p>
      <p><em>There will be no financial impact on ICANN

  <li><h3><a name="2"></a>Approval of the 2011-2014
      Strategic Plan</h3>
    <p>Whereas, ICANN's July 2011 through June 2014
      Strategic Plan seeks to provide four areas of
      high level strategic focus for ICANN.</p>
    <p>Whereas, ICANN's July 2011 through June 2014
      Strategic Plan identifies in addition to four
      areas of focus, enablers across all areas to
      reflect ICANN's responsibilities towards a multi-stakeholder
      model, collaboration, and being international,
      transparent and accountable.</p>
    <p>Whereas, ICANN's July 2011 through June 2014
      Strategic Plan captures strategic objectives
      and strategic projects, details of community
      work and staff work will be reflected in the
      operational plan and identifies strategic performance
      metrics.</p>
    <p>Whereas, ICANN's Strategic Plan is based on
      input from the ICANN Staff, community organizations,
      ICANN Board of Directors, public consultations
      on ICANN's website, and presentations at the
      ICANN Cartagena meeting and to constituency groups.</p>
    <p>Whereas, the Strategic Plan will form the framework
      around which the July 2011 through June 2012
      Operational Plan and the associated budget are
      constructed.</p>
    <p>Whereas, members of the community have been
      very generous with their time and the Board appreciates
      the work that they have done.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.13), the Board approves
      the July 2011-June 2014 Strategic Plan, and directs
      the President and staff to move forward with
      the community-based Operational planning process
      based on the strategic objectives as set forth
      in the plan. Minor edits will be provided to
      staff by the Board before close of business on
      Monday 21 March 2011, and final changes will
      be subject to the Chairman's final approval.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>Rationale for Resolution 2011.03.18.13</em></p>
      <p><em>What Stakeholders or others were consulted?</em></p>
      <p><em>As part of this extensive review, ICANN
          conducted many community consultations that
          were held to receive input. These included
          meetings with the ccNSO Strategy and Operations
          Planning Group, GNSO leadership, ALAC, and
          RALOs (separately). During the recent Silicon
          Valley Board Workshop, the Board formed a
          working group that was to discuss strategic
          planning and to provide direction. This group
          is comprised of Steve Crocker, Bruce Tonkin,
          Katim Touray, Mike Silber, Ramaraj, Ray Plzak,
          Dennis Jennings (ret), and Jonne Soininen
          (ret).</em></p>
      <p><em>What concerns or issues were raised by
          the community?</em></p>
      <p><em>Following the public comment period (27
          November 2010 - extended to 25 January 2011)
          and the continued consultations, the three
          areas outlined below where identified as
          being areas of concern that needed refinement.</em></p>
      <p><em>1. Re-organization of objectives to: (a)
          distinguish areas of Influence versus Control,
          and (b) clarify levels of engagement.</em></p>
      <p><em>Based on consultations with the Board
          Working Group, the language in the first
          sections of each of the focus areas was revised
          to amplify and clarify the role of ICANN's
          Influence versus Control in each of the strategic
          focus areas.</em></p>
      <p><em>2. Establish more measurable objectives
          with: (a) clear definition of desired outcomes,
          and (b) a consistent evaluation model.</em></p>
      <p><em>Performance metrics have been added to
          each focus area that provide measureable
          metrics to gauge ICANN's progress toward
          the strategic goals. Relevant comments were
          incorporated that added clarity to the Strategic
          Plan's various objectives. For example, one
          of the pillar labels was changed from&quot; Consumer
          Choice, Competition and Innovation,&quot; to &quot;Competition,
          Consumer Trust and Consumer Choice&quot; to
          specifically align language with the Affirmation
          of Commitments; the &quot;Healthy Internet
          Eco-System&quot; was modified to &quot;A
          Healthy Internet Governance Eco-System.&quot;</em></p>
      <p><em>3. Revised and added additional wording
          for clarity.</em></p>
      <p><em>Language in the prose sections that describes
          the objectives in more detail have been standardized
          and a set of more measurable strategic objectives
          were listed at the close of each section.</em></p>
      <p><em>Are there Positive or Negative Community
          Impacts?</em></p>
      <p><em>There are positive impacts because the
          Community will see in the updated Strategic
          Plan that their feedback was taken into account
          and thus the multi-stakeholder bottom-up
          decision-making model is being implemented.
          Secondly, the Strategic Plan is refined to
          incorporate strategic performance metrics
          in alignment with Community feedback and
          expectation.</em></p>
      <p><em>This plan also includes 36 new performance
          metrics that ICANN will now carry forward
          into the Operations Planning process to link
          the Strategic Planning process to the Operating
          and Budget planning processes. ICANN will
          also need to develop the tracking and reporting
          mechanisms for these new performance metrics
          to provide greater transparency and accountability.</em></p>
      <p><em>This year's planning process was planned
          to be a &quot;dusting off&quot; of the previous
          plan, but resulted in more substantial adjustments
          following extensive Community participation
          and feedback. In order to accommodate the
          information, the consultation process was
          adjusted accordingly, which delayed the timeline
          from a planned approval in Cartagena (December
          2010) to the Silicon Valley meeting in San
          Francisco (March 2011).</em></p>
      <p><em>Anticipating that future planning processes
          will result in similarly intensive engagements,
          the Strategic Planning cycle will be started
          earlier next year. That planning cycle will
          be published shortly.</em></p>
      <p><em>The remainder of the annual planning cycle
          includes: approval of the Strategic Plan,
          incorporation of the Strategic Plan into
          the Operating Plan framework (currently in
          process), and finally development of the
          next fiscal year Budget (planned for approval
          in June). A framework of the proposed Operating
          Plan is posted and anticipates many features
          of this proposed Strategic Plan.</em></p>

    <p><em>As part of ICANN's planning process, the
        adopted Strategic Plan guides the development
        of the FY12 Operating Plan and Budget. Historically,

  <li><h3><a name="3"></a>Process for Completion of
      the Applicant Guidebook for New gTLDs</h3>
    <p>Whereas, the Board and Governmental Advisory
      Committee held a successful intersessional meeting
      in Brussels with the intention to identify areas
      of difference between the proposed implementation
      and the GAC's advice, and, where possible, reach
      agreement on those issues.</p>
    <p>Whereas, the Board and GAC have conducted in-depth
      discussions during the San Francisco meeting
      to continue the good-faith effort to reach mutually
      acceptable solutions on the issues identified
      by the GAC in its Scorecard.</p>
    <p>Whereas, the Board has reviewed and considered
      the comments made by constituency groups, stakeholder
      groups, and individuals in the broader community
      during the San Francisco meeting.</p>
    <p>Whereas, ICANN Bylaws Article XI, Section 2.1j
      provides that &quot;The advice of the Governmental
      Advisory Committee on public policy matters shall
      be duly taken into account, both in the formulation
      and adoption of policies. In the event that the
      ICANN Board determines to take an action that
      is not consistent with the Governmental Advisory
      Committee advice, it shall so inform the Committee
      and state the reasons why it decided not to follow
      that advice. The Governmental Advisory Committee
      and the ICANN Board will then try, in good faith
      and in a timely and efficient manner, to find
      a mutually acceptable solution.&quot;</p>
    <p>Whereas, in its efforts to implement the Bylaws-mandated
      process, ICANN (i) developed preliminary briefing
      papers on each of the GAC topics identified in
      the GAC Communiqué from Cartagena; (ii) conducted
      informal calls between ICANN and GAC subject
      matter experts; (iii) participated in a nearly-three
      day meeting in Brussels with the GAC; (iv) reviewed
      the GAC scorecard and provided comprehensive
      Board notes on the scorecard.</p>
    <p>Whereas, these inputs have been duly considered
      by the Board.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.14), the Board thanks the
      GAC for the many hours of intense work preparing
      for and conducting the recent Board-GAC exchanges,
      and thanks for the community for its continuing
      support and cooperation.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.15), the Board adopts a
      working timeline for completion of the Applicant
      Guidebook and launch of the New gTLD process
      as posted at <a href="/web/20110423020356/http://icann.org/en/minutes/draft-timeline-new-gtlds-18mar11-en.pdf">http://www.icann.org/en/minutes/draft-timeline-new-gtlds-18mar11-en.pdf</a> [PDF,
      117 KB].</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.16), as set forth in the
      timetable, ICANN will target 15 April 2011 as
      the date for publication of a final response
      to the GAC Scorecard, along with Applicant Guidebook
      extracts showing changes.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.17), the Board intends
      to complete the process set forth in the timeline
      in time for final approval of the New gTLD implementation
      program at an extraordinary meeting of the ICANN
      Board to be held on Monday, 20 June 2011, at
      the ICANN meetings in Singapore. (Note: the Board
      also intends to hold its usual meeting on Friday
      morning, 24 June 2011, to conclude the mid-year

    <h3><a name="4"></a>AOC Reviews, Including ATRT
      Recommendations</h3>
    <p>Whereas, the Accountability and Transparency
      Review Team (ATRT) Report provided 27 recommendations
      to improve ICANN, and the Affirmation of Commitments
      obligates ICANN to take action on the Report
      by 30 June 2011.</p>
    <p>Whereas, the Board encouraged public comment
      and input from ICANN organizations on the Report.</p>
    <p>Whereas, Staff has provided 27 proposed initial
      implementation proposals, along with proposed
      budgets and timelines for Board review.</p>
    <p>Whereas, the Board finds that all 27 of the
      recommendations have the potential to advance
      ICANN's transparency and accountability objectives
      and may be implemented by ICANN following careful
      and transparent consideration, and with the necessary
      support and resources.</p>
    <p>Whereas, some of the ATRT recommendations relate
      to operations that staff has already changed,
      or is in the process of changing, thanks to ATRT
      guidance, and some recommendations will require
      additional time, resources, and consultations
      to implement.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.18), the Board received
      the initial implementation plans, and directs
      staff to publish them as soon as feasible.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.19), the Board requests
      that ICANN Staff provide the Board with final
      proposed plans for the implementation of the
      ATRT recommendations in time for Board consideration
      as soon as possible.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.20), the Board requests
      input on the cost of the implementation of all
      of the ATRT recommendations, and advice for consideration
      at the April 2011 Board meeting concerning the
      estimated budget implications for the FY2012
      budget.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.21), the Board requests
      that the Governmental Advisory Committee and
      the Nominating Committee work with the Board
      on implementation of recommendations involving
      their organizations.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.22), to fully respond to
      the obligations in the Affirmation of Commitments,
      the Board requests that ICANN Staff develop proposed
      metrics to quantify and track activities called
      for in the Affirmation and ATRT report, and benchmarks
      that enable ICANN to compare its accountability
      and transparency-related efforts to international
      entities' best practices.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>Rationale for Resolutions 2011.03.18.18
          - 2011.03.18.22</em></p>
      <p><em>As required by the Affirmation of Commitments,
          the recommendations resulting from the Accountability
          and Transparency Review Team (ATRT) were
          provided to the Board on 31 December 2010
          and posted for public comment. The ATRT provided
          a constructive report that validates and
          builds upon ICANN's commitments and improvements.
          The Board encouraged and considered input
          from the community, including the Supporting
          Organizations, Advisory Committees, and the
          Nominating Committee, and reviewed the staff's
          input and proposed implementation plans.
          The public comments were supportive of the
          ATRT report and staff's due diligence resulted
          in advice that ICANN move forward with implementation
          work on the ATRT's 27 recommendations.</em></p>
      <p><em>The Board finds that these recommendations:
          have the potential to advance ICANN's transparency
          and accountability objectives, which are
          articulated in the Affirmation and ICANN's
          bylaws; may be implemented by ICANN (pending
          resource allocation); and do not appear to
          negatively impact the systemic security,
          stability and resiliency of the DNS. The
          Board has asked staff to work with affected
          organizations and develop final implementation
          plans for Board approval, and notes that
          ICANN has already made progress on implementation
          of several operational changes called for
          by the ATRT.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>Finally, the Board has asked staff to develop
        metrics and benchmarks for consideration. Without
        agreement on clear, measurable actions, future
        transparency and accountability improvement
        efforts and assessments could be hampered.</em></p>

  <li><h3><a name="5"></a>Approval of ICM Registry
      Application for .XXX</h3>
    <p>Whereas, on 25 June 2010, the ICANN Board, after
      substantial public comment was received on the
      process options available to ICANN to consider
      the Independent Review Panel's Declaration of
      19 February 2010, the Board accepted (in part)
      the findings  of the Panel. The Board then directed
      staff &quot;to conduct expedited due diligence
      to ensure that: (1) the ICM Application is still
      current; and (2) there have been no changes in
      ICM's qualifications.&quot;</p>
    <p>Whereas, ICANN staff performed the required
      due diligence, that showed that the ICM Application
      remains current and that there have been no negative
      changes in ICM's qualifications.</p>
    <p>Whereas, ICM provided ICANN with a new proposed
      registry agreement that included additional provisions,
      requirements and safeguards to address the issues
      that the GAC and other community members had
      raised with respect to the previously proposed
      agreement.</p>
    <p>Whereas, the proposed registry agreement and
      due diligence materials were posted for public
      comment. Over 700 comments were received, though
      few of the comments addressed the terms of the
      registry agreement. No changes to the registry
      agreement are recommended in response to the
      comments.</p>
    <p>Whereas, on 10 December 2010, the Board agreed
      with an assessment that entering into the proposed
      registry agreement would conflict with only three
      items of GAC advice and directed the staff to
      communicate this information to the GAC.</p>
    <p>Whereas, on 10 December 2010, the Board further
      determined that it intends to enter into a registry
      agreement with ICM Registry for the .XXX sTLD,
      subject to GAC consultation and advice, and thereby
      invoked the consultation as provided for in ICANN
      Bylaws section Article XI, Section 2, Paragraph
      1(j). See &lt;<a href="/web/20110423020356/http://icann.org/en/minutes/resolutions-10dec10-en.htm#4">http://www.icann.org/en/minutes/resolutions-10dec10-en.htm#4</a>&gt;.</p>
    <p>Whereas, to facilitate the Bylaws consultation
      with the GAC, on 25 January 2011, the Board directed
      staff to forward a letter from the Board to the
      GAC clearly setting forth the Board's position
      on how the ICM proposed registry agreement meets
      items of GAC advice, and setting forth the items
      of GAC advice remaining for consultation. The
      letter was forwarded on 11 February 2011 and
      is available at &lt;<a href="/web/20110423020356/http://icann.org/en/correspondence/jeffrey-to-to-dryden-10feb11-en.pdf">http://www.icann.org/en/correspondence/jeffrey-to-to-dryden-10feb11-en.pdf</a>&gt; [PDF,
      236 KB].</p>
    <p>Whereas, on 16 March 2011, the GAC forwarded
      a letter of the Board clarifying GAC advice on
      the ICM matter.</p>
    <p>Whereas, the Board has carefully considered
      comments from the community and the GAC in making
      this decision, in furtherance of ICANN's mission.</p>
    <p>Whereas, on 17 March 2011, the Board and the
      GAC completed a formal Bylaws consultation on
      those items for which entering the registry agreement
      might not be consistent with GAC advice.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.23), the Board authorizes
      either the CEO or the General Counsel to execute
      the proposed registry agreement for the .XXX
      sTLD, in substantially the same form posted for
      public comment in August 2010.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.24), the Board adopts and
      fully incorporates herein its Rationale for Approving
      Registry Agreement with ICM for .XXX sTLD &lt;<a href="/web/20110423020356/http://icann.org/en/minutes/draft-icm-rationale-18mar11-en.pdf">http://www.icann.org/en/minutes/draft-icm-rationale-18mar11-en.pdf</a>&gt; [PDF,
      221 KB]  to
      support the entering into the proposed registry
      agreement.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.25), the Board and the
      GAC have completed a good faith consultation
      under the ICANN Bylaws, Article XI, Section 2.j.
      As the Board and the GAC were not able to reach
      a mutually acceptable solution, pursuant to ICANN
      Bylaws, Article XI, Section 2.k, the Board incorporates
      and adopts as set forth in the Rationale the
      reasons why the GAC advice was not followed.
      The Board's statement is without prejudice to
      the rights or obligations of GAC members with
      regard to public policy issues falling within
      their responsibilities.</p>

    <h3><a name="6"></a>Approval of Expenses Related
      to Board-Directed Activities</h3>
    <p>Whereas, on 29 June 2010, the ICANN Board passed
      the FY11 Operating Plan and Budget.</p>
    <p>Whereas, during FY11, the Board has undertaken
      several activities that were not addressed in
      the budget.</p>
    <p>Whereas, the budget for these items were presented
      on 13 March 2011 to the Board Finance Committee
      (BFC).</p>
    <p>Whereas, the Board Finance Committee recommends
      that the Board confirm the proposed budgets for
      these activities, directing the CEO to stay within
      the total overall FY11 approved budget, if feasible,
      by funding these items from the contingency line
      item of USD$1.5M.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.26), the Board confirms
      that the CEO has been directed to undertake the
      activities for which the additional budget numbers
      have been recommended by the Board Finance Committee.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.27), the Board approves
      the proposed budgets for the following additional
      activities in FY11 in an amount not to exceed
      $1,640,000.00: (i) AOC Reviews; (ii) third Board
      Retreat; (iii) GAC Meeting; (iv) IDN Variant
      Panel; and (v) ATRT Recommendations. The Board
      further directs the CEO to use the USD$1.5M contingency
      line item to stay, if feasible, within the total
      amount of the FY11 approved budget when implementing
      these activities.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>Rationale for Resolutions 2011.03.18.26
          – 2011.03.18.27</em></p>
      <p><em>The Board had previously approved the
          important activities that are addressed in
          this resolution. At the time the Board approved
          the activities, the budgets for the additional
          items were not available. Thus, the BFC has
          now approved the budget for these additional
          activities and the Board has confirmed its
          approval of the activities in light of the
          budget for them.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>The approval of these additional line items
        should have a positive public effect in that
        it increases transparency of the amount spent
        on such important activities undertaken by
        ICANN in this fiscal year. There financial
        impact on ICANN is evident from the budget
        and the direction for the CEO to remain within
        the original FY11 budget, if feasible. It does
        not appear that there will be any financial
        impact on the ICANN Community. Approval of
        these budget lines items does not present any
        impact on the systemic security, stability
        and resiliency of the DNS.</em></p>

  <li><h3><a name="7"></a>TLG Review – Actions Based
      on Independent Reviewer's Final Report</h3>
    <p>Whereas, the independent reviewers for the Technical
      Liaison Group (TLG) Review have delivered a final
      report, which contains conclusions and recommendations
      for enhancing the effectiveness of this structure,
      primarily by abandoning the current structure
      and potentially to replace it with bilateral
      or other arrangements.</p>
    <p>Whereas, the report has been posted for public
      comments, both at the draft stage and in its
      final version, and some comments received have
      raised concerns about the future of the relationships
      between ICANN and other members of the Internet
      technical community.</p>
    <p>Whereas, the Board agrees with the Structural
      Improvements Committee (SIC) on its proposal
      to thank the independent reviewers and the others
      involved in commenting and advancing the activities
      of the review for their commitment and contributions;
      and</p>
    <p>Whereas, the Board agrees with the SIC on its
      proposal to establish a Board Working Group to
      consider measures to enhance the coordination
      and cooperation between ICANN and other members
      of the Internet technical community before deciding
      on any dismantling of the TLG.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.28), the Board accepts
      the Final Report on the TLG Review from JAS Communications
      LLC and thanks the independent reviewers, staff
      and the SIC members for their work with this
      review.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.29), the Board establishes
      the Board Technical Relations Working Group to
      consider measures to enhance the coordination
      and cooperation between ICANN and other members
      of the Internet technical community with the
      intent of, among other things, dissolving the
      TLG by the 2011 Annual Meeting; and asks the
      Working Group to engage the ICANN community in
      a fully consultative process on the coordination
      and cooperation between ICANN and other members
      of the Internet technical community.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.30), the Board requests
      the BGC to nominate five members of this working
      group, one of whom to serve as Chair for consideration
      at the Board meeting of 21 April 2011.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.31), the Board requests
      that the SIC develop a charter for this Working
      Group based upon the report of the TLG review,
      comments to that review and any other available
      information, for consideration at the Board meeting

  <li><h3><a name="8"></a>IDN ccTLD Fast Track Review</h3>
    <p>Whereas, the Final Implementation Plan for the
      IDN ccTLD Fast Track Process was approved by
      the ICANN Board at its annual meeting in Seoul,
      Republic of Korea on 30 October 2009 and launched
      on 16 November 2009.</p>
    <p>Whereas, the Final Implementation Plan requires
      annual review of the process, and the ICANN Board
      directed staff to &quot;monitor the operation
      of the IDN ccTLD Fast Track process at regular
      intervals to ensure its smooth operation, and,
      subject to Board review, update the process when
      new technology or policies become available,
      with the goal to efficiently meet the needs of
      Fast Track process requesters, and to best meet
      the needs of the global Internet community.&quot;</p>
    <p>Whereas, ICANN has completed the first review
      of the IDN ccTLD Fast Track Process, conducted
      in two parts: A public session held during the
      ICANN meeting in Cartagena on 6 December 2010
      and an online public comment forum running from
      22 October to 17 December 2010 and subsequently
      extended to 31 January 2011 at community request.</p>
    <p>Whereas, ICANN released on 21 February 2011
      a review of the received comments with accompanied
      ICANN recommendations and general feedback.</p>
    <p>Whereas, the Board notes that the Fast Track

      the Review of the IDN ccTLD Fast Track Process&quot; and
      directs the CEO to have the identified work performed.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.33), the Board thanks the
      community for participation in the first annual
      review of the Fast Track process, and acknowledges
      that the first review of the Fast Track process

          and 2011.03.18.33</em></p>
      <p><em>Why the Board is addressing the issue
          now?</em></p>
      <p><em>As approved by the Board, the IDN ccTLD
          Fast Track process calls for staff to conduct
          a review of the process on an annual basis.
          The IDN ccTLD Fast Track Program launched
          in November 2009, and commenced its first
          review in October 2010.</em></p>
      <p><em>What are the proposals being considered?</em></p>
      <p><em>Many proposals were received by the community
          within the review, including proposals that
          called for changes to the limited nature
          of the Fast Track process. In maintaining
          a focus is on what necessary changes could
          be made to enhance the Fast Track while remaining
          true to the limited nature of the process,
          no overreaching proposals were considered.
          Instead, proposals regarding clarifications
          in communications with requesters and better
          education on the process were the primary
          proposals taken under consideration.</em></p>
      <p><em>What Stakeholders or others were consulted?</em></p>
      <p><em>A public comment period was held from
          22 October 2010 to 31 January 2011 and an
          open consultation session was hosted at the
          ICANN Cartagena meeting, with interactive
          participation from those in Cartagena and
          those participating remotely worldwide. Both
          forums allowed for extensive community participation
          from members of the DNS technical community
          and ccTLD community, as well as individual
          Internet users.</em></p>
      <p><em>What concerns or issues were raised by
          the community?</em></p>
      <p><em>As detailed in the Annex, there were general
          concerns about the limited nature of the
          IDN ccTLD Fast Track process. Specific issues
          included the lack of an appeal process, IDN
          tables, and transparency of the process while
          a request is pending. Other operational concerns
          included operational issues such as confusion
          between the documentation requirements for
          string evaluation and the IANA delegation
          process. Ongoing work is currently in place
          to address the operational concerns.</em></p>

          [PDF, 268 KB].</em></p>
      <p><em>What factors the Board Found to be Significant?</em></p>
      <p><em>Despite its limited scope, the IDN ccTLD
          Fast Track Process works well. Since its
          launch, the IDN ccTLD Fast Track Program
          received requests from 34 different countries/territories,
          25 countries/territories have completed the
          string evaluation stage of the process, and
          17 countries/territories (represented by
          27 IDN ccTLDs) are delegated in the DNS root
          zone. Continued actions are being taken to
          address the operational issues expressed
          in the review to improve communication with
          requesters. The ongoing improvements in education
          and communications work, along with the identified
          consultation work recommended by staff, are
          all significant in determining that no major
          changes should be instituted in the Fast
          Track Process. In addition, the ongoing policy
          work in the ccNSO regarding broader introductions
          of IDN ccTLDs offers another arena for concerns
          to be raised and addressed.</em></p>
      <p><em>Are there Positive or Negative Community
          Impacts?</em></p>
      <p><em>Many of the comments received were from
          the Bulgarian Internet community expressed
          disappointment about the rejection of the
          applied-for string reporting that there may
          be a negative impact on that community if
          no appeals mechanism is instituted within
          the process. However, maintaining the limited
          scope of the Fast Track, and allowing the
          ongoing IDN policy work to continue without
          interference, will have a positive community
          impact in maintaining the accountability
          of ICANN to its processes.</em></p>
      <p><em>Are there fiscal impacts/ramifications
          on ICANN (Strategic Plan, Operating Plan,
          Budget); the community; and/or the public?</em></p>
      <p><em>There may be additional costs in conducting
          outreach, though minimal. Greater involvement
          with the browser and application developer
          community may require broader support from
          the community and supporting organizations.
          Additional staff and/or consultant resources
          will be required to provide expertise in
          order to support work on IDN tables or variants.
          Had substantial changes to the current IDN
          ccTLD Fast Track Process been considered,
          those would likely have required funding
          for additional resources</em></p>
      <p><em>Are there any Security, Stability or Resiliency
          issues relating to the DNS?</em></p>

    <p><em>The careful management of the IDN ccTLD
        Fast Track process is intended to ensure that
        strings do not cause DNS security and stability

          224 KB].</em></p>
      <p><em>• What factors the Board Found to be Significant?</em></p>
      <p><em>1. ICANN conducted the threshold security,
          stability and competition review on the proposed
          service pursuant to the RSEP, and did not
          identify any significant issues. Numeric-only
          names have been allowed in 14 gTLDs and several
          ccTLDs for years without harm to the security
          or stability of the Internet. From a purely
          technical point of view, there is no difference
          on what TLD allows the numeric-only names,
          therefore there is no new issue created by
          this proposal. ICANN advised VeriSign that
          an amendment to Appendices 6, Schedule of
          Reserved Names, and 11, Registration Restrictions,
          would be necessary to implement the new service.</em></p>
      <p><em>2. The proposed amendment was available
          for public comment from 16 September 2010
          through 16 October 2010; four comments were
          received, one of them was not related to
          the proposal, one did not address the merits
          of the proposal, one raised two potential
          issues, and one was supportive. The comment
          period produced no clear consensus view on
          whether or not the amendment should be approved;
          each commenter provided input suggesting
          a different path, and some issues, described
          above, were noted.</em></p>
      <p><em>3. One comment, from Steven Metalitz,
          suggested that the proposal might constitute
          a fundamental change to the TLD. ICANN posed
          this very question to VeriSign upon receiving
          the Request. Metalitz additionally noted
          that the proposed expansion of &quot;Personal
          Name&quot; definition could have an impact
          on the defensive registrations that would
          be required by a trademark owner.</em></p>
      <p><em>4. To address Mr. Metalitz's remarks,
          VeriSign provided additional information
          to ICANN in a letter on 7 January 2011 stating
          that &quot;The proposed change to permit
          pure number and number-hyphen domain names
          is not a fundamental change to the .name
          TLD, as the .name TLD will continue to be
          for individuals for their personal use.&quot;,
          further adding that, &quot;Additionally,
          numbers in the context of .name are relevant
          at this time because of how people around
          the world now use the web and the Internet.
          In many places in the world, especially in
          developing countries, mobile has become the
          predominate form of communication and interface
          to the web. A phone number is how one is
          known. And, typing numbers on a phone interface
          is often easier than typing letters.&quot;</em></p>
      <p><em>5. Further, VeriSign stated that &quot;Challenges
          relating to the registration of pure number
          or number-hyphen .name domain names would
          be addressed under the Eligibility Requirements
          Dispute Resolution Policy.&quot; Lastly,
          VeriSign also mentioned two services it offers
          to the IP and brand protection community
          that would help mitigate the perceived issue.
          With regard to trademark protection, it is
          also worth noting that .NAME is directed
          to individuals for personal use, and not
          for business.</em></p>
      <p><em>6. To address a Board member question,
          VeriSign provided additional information
          to ICANN in a letter on 28 February 2011
          stating that &quot;The .name Top Level Domain
          (TLD) was originally conceived to represent
          an individual's personal identity on the
          Internet. But more importantly, the purpose
          of the .name TLD was to make available domains
          for personal use,&quot; further adding that &quot;[s]ince
          it [.NAME] was introduced, the way people
          identify themselves on-line has evolved from
          just one's personal name and/or nickname
          to also include their monikers or handles
          for their avatars, for blogging, and for
          use in different social media channels to
          represent themselves on-line. In developing
          regions of the world, with the rapid growth
          of mobile phones, where there's been lagging
          development of high-speed broadband landline
          infrastructure and PC penetration, the use
          of one's mobile number has become more important
          and prevalent for accessing the Internet.
          One's personal identify in these parts of
          the world has grown to include one's mobile
          number.&quot;</em></p>
      <p><em>7. In that 28 February 2011 letter VeriSign
          further stated that &quot;removing the pure
          number restriction would provide .name with
          parity with all other gTLDs now that ICANN
          has approved TelNic's similar RSEP in January
          2011.&quot; By approving the proposal, .NAME
          would be in a better position to compete
          with the rest of the gTLDs in the market,
          which in turn, would provide more options
          to registrants.</em></p>
      <p><em>• Are there Positive or Negative Community
          Impacts?</em></p>
      <p><em>By approving the proposed amendment, the
          gTLD market will be more competitive by allowing
          .NAME to have a similar offering to the rest
          of the gTLDs, and more importantly, the registrants
          will have more options to choose for registration.</em></p>
      <p><em>• Are there fiscal impacts/ramifications
          on ICANN (Strategic Plan, Operating Plan,
          Budget); the community; and/or the public?</em></p>

          there will be a negative public impact if

    <h3><a name="11"></a>Engagement of Independent

    <p>Whereas, the ICANN Bylaws in Article XVI &lt;<a href="/web/20110423020356/http://icann.org/general/bylaws.htm">http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm</a>&gt;,
      requires that after the end of the fiscal year,
      the books of ICANN must be audited by certified
      public accountants. The Bylaws also state that
      the appointment of the fiscal auditors shall
      be the responsibility of the Board.</p>
    <p>Whereas, the Board Audit Committee has discussed
      the engagement of the independent auditor for
      the fiscal year ending 30 June 2011, and has
      recommended that the Board engage Moss Adams
      LLP.</p>
    <p>Whereas, the Board Audit Committee has recommended
      that the Board direct staff to execute a professional
      services agreement with Moss Adams, subject to
      review by the Chair of the Audit Committee.</p>
    <p>Resolved (2011.03.18.36), the Board authorizes
      the Chief Executive Officer to engage Moss Adams
      LLP as the auditors for the financial statements
      for the fiscal year ending 30 June 2011.</p>

    <p>Whereas, <a href="/web/20110423020356/http://icann.org/en/minutes/prelim-report-30jul09.htm">on July
        30, 2009</a> the Board approved a Transitional
        Charter for the GNSO's Non Commercial Stakeholder
        Group (NCSG).</p>
    <p>Whereas, Section 8.1 of the NCSG Transitional
      Charter provided that a final NCSG charter be
      established by no later than the Board Meeting
      during the 2011 ICANN Annual General Meeting.</p>

  <li><h3><a name="14"></a>Proposed Process for Recognition
      of New Constituencies in GNSO: Extension of Public
      Comment</h3>
    <p>Whereas, in June 2008, the ICANN Board of Directors
      endorsed a series of recommendations concerning
      how to improve the GNSO's structures and operations
      and those improvements included recommendations
      endorsed by the Board to clarify and promote
      the option to self-form new GNSO Constituencies.</p>
    <p>Whereas, the Board directed ICANN Staff to develop
      and administer procedures that a prospective
      organizer could follow in submitting a petition
      to become approved as a new GNSO Constituency,
      and initial procedures were implemented.</p>
    <p>Whereas, after some experience with those procedures,
      the Structural Improvements Committee identified
      opportunities for improvement to those procedures.,
      and developed a proposed replacement &quot;Process
      for Recognition of New GNSO Constituencies.&quot;</p>
    <p>Whereas, the SIC's proposed new process significantly
      modifies the original procedures and is designed
      to accomplish the following goals:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Optimize the time and effort required to
        form, organize, and propose a new GNSO Constituency
        through prescribing a streamlined sequence
        of steps and associated evaluation objective,
        fair, and transparent criteria, and preserving
        opportunity for community input.</li>
      <li>Delegate more authority to each GNSO Stakeholder
        Group in evaluating new Constituency proposals
        while maintaining the Board's oversight role.</li>
      <li>Manage the entire process to a flexible,
        but specific and limited timeframe; and</li>
      <li>Provide a partial set of criteria for use
        during the periodic review of the GNSO.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Whereas, the SIC authorized staff to open a
      Public Consultation Forum (PCF) on the Process
      for Recognition of New GNSO Constituencies to
      allow for community feedback. The PCF was opened
      on 2 February 2011 for an initial period of 30
      days, within which two comments were received.</p>
    <p>Whereas, the SIC recommends that the community
      would benefit from additional time to review,
      discuss and comment on the proposed new process,
      and that the PCF should be extended.</p>
    <p>RESOLVED (2011.03.18.39), the Board directs
      the CEO to extend the PCF on the Proposed Process
      for Recognition of New GNSO Constituencies (<a href="/web/20110423020356/http://icann.org/en/public-comment/public-comment-201103-en.htm#newco-process-recognition">http://www.icann.org/en/public-comment/public-comment-201103-en.htm#newco-process-recognition</a>)
      for two additional weeks after conclusion of
      the ICANN Silicon Valley Public Meeting, closing
      3 April 2011.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>Rationale for Resolution 2011.03.18.39</em></p>
      <p><em>The promotion of new GNSO Constituencies
          was one of the fundamental recommendations
          of the GNSO Review effort and an important
          strategy to expand participation in GNSO
          policy development efforts. The extension
          of this public consultation forum (PCF) will
          give community members more opportunity to
          submit comments on a proposal designed to
          improve existing processes. No budget resources
          will be impacted by this extension of the
          consultation period and further management
          of the PCF is within normal operational parameters.
          The extension of the PCF does not have any
          impact on the security, stability or resiliency
          of the DNS.</em></p>
